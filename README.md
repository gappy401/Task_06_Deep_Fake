# Task_06_Deep_Fake

## Overview
This project transforms a fictional sports narrative into an AI-generated deep fake interview. The goal was to simulate a realistic street-style conversation using free tools, while documenting the creative and technical process.

## Narrative Summary
The interview features "Coach Carter," a fictional Syracuse University basketball coach, reflecting on the team's performance last season and sharing insights for the upcoming one. Topics include:
- Defensive weaknesses  
- Star player development  
- Strategy shifts for ACC competition

## Interview Script

**Jay (Interviewer)**: Coach Carter! Quick word—what went wrong last season?

**Coach Carter**: Defense. We gave up too many second-chance points. That’s changing.

**Jay**: Who’s stepping up this year?

**Coach Carter**: Freshman guard Malik Johnson. Kid’s got fire. Watch him.

**Jay**: Any message for SU fans?

**Coach Carter**: Pack the Dome. We’re coming back stronger.

## Technical Reflection

This project allowed me to explore and refine several STEM-related skills, particularly in AI media synthesis and computer vision. I studied motion transfer and latent space manipulation by reading papers like *First Order Motion Model for Image Animation*, *StyleGAN-T*, and *Make-A-Video*. These helped me understand how keypoint extraction, GAN architectures, and diffusion models contribute to realistic facial animation and text-to-video generation. I also gained hands-on experience with inference pipelines, multimodal alignment, and voice cloning using transformer-based models. Overall, this was a deep dive into the intersection of generative AI, storytelling, and synthetic media production.

## Visual Snippet: `snipp.png`

This image captures a remarkably natural-looking AI-generated interview between Coach Carter and reporter Jay. From the subtle facial expressions to the realistic lighting and clothing textures, the scene mimics a genuine sports media moment. Behind the realism lies a blend of deep learning techniques: motion transfer models animate facial movements using keypoint tracking, while GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) refine visual fidelity. Voice synthesis aligns lip motion with dialogue, creating seamless audiovisual coherence. The result is a convincing deep fake that showcases how AI can simulate human interaction with cinematic precision.
